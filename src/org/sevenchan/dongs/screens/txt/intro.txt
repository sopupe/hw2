	The darkened skies have been pouring a cold, miserable rain upon the convoy as it snaked around the black cliffs for weeks.
	Wagons getting stuck in the thick black mud was common, and the horses were tense, to say the least.  Even a pebble 
	rolling down from the cliff above was enough to set them off, and the frequent imp attacks were not helping the situation.
	Only a third of the original convoy from Aldoria was left, and they were all pitiful souls; All malnourished, hungry, 
	and tired.  However, they all know they cannot fail to reach the destination, which is now exposed as the 
	clouds part and the rain is left behind.  The convoy hesistantly halts to rest, and you have your first chance to 
	examine the volcanic plains of Therma.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;By the Gods...&quot; you hear someone croak behind you.
</p>
<p>
	Startled, you whip around to see a pale, sunken face, scarred heavily by time and a lack of food and sleep.  
	It takes you a few moments to recognise King Gregor, but you nod, turning back to the lava-scarred landscape ahead.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;I still can't beleive anything can survive in that hellish wasteland,&quot; you concur with the King, gesturing at the massive 
	cone-snaped volcano dominating the skyline.  The red sky is brightened by yet another eruption, which tosses 
	thousands of burning rocks, some the size of a castle, thundering down onto the landscape below. You shiver, despite the growing heat. 
	&quot;Are you absolutely sure about this, my leige?&quot;  You turn to him, as do several  observing soldiers.  
</p>
<p>
	The king's eyes harden into intense determination. &quot;If Aldoria is to survive, we must proceed.  There are no alternatives.&quot;
</p>
<p>
	On his word, the convoy of horses, soldiers, and wagons lurch forward, and enter the demonic lands ahead, and spend the day dodging lava bombs
	and orc raids, all while scaling the immense, booming  Mount Terror.
</p>
<p>
	A year ago, before the demons burst through into the world and began the systematic destruction of Aldoria, wiser men
	would have called the mission insane.  But now, with nothing more to do, and no choices left, the last convoy of free men 
	scale the  sharp, hot, volcanic rock of Mount Terror, using their last ounces of strength to make it to the summit.  
	Many succumb to the heat, lava, and rock slides, but soon, it is just you and the king standing at the rim of the 
	volcano, staring down at the swirling vortex of molten rock below.
</p>
<p>
	You look up at the king, and a single tear flows down his ashen cheek.  Years of happy memories play through your 
	head, remembering your friendship with the king back when you were both young. &quot;I will sorely miss your companionship and loyalty,&quot; 
	he rasps, coughing on the thick, foul smoke that hangs in the air. &quot;I will await your return.&quot; You exchange an embrace with the frail, 
	but young king, and then take a few steps back from the edge and fling yourself into the searing heat below.
</p>
<p>
	Your body screams from the heat, but, as trained by the elves who inhabited the now-burning Great Woods, you clear your 
	mind and concentrate on the task ahead, and one name.
