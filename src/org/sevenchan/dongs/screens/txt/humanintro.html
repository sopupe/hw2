	The darkened skies had been pouring a cold, miserable rain upon the convoy as it snaked around the blackened cliffs for weeks.
	Wagons getting stuck in the thick black mud was common, and the horses were tense, to say the least.  Even a pebble 
	rolling down from the cliff above was enough to startle the beasts, and the frequent imp incursions during the night were not helping 
	the army's situation very much.
</p>
<p>
	Only a third of the original convoy from Aldoria is left, and they are all pitiful souls; All malnourished, hungry, 
	and tired.  However, they all know they must reach the destination at all costs, the destination you now see as the acidic fog 
	thins, exposing the volcanic plains of Therma below.  The convoy reluctantly grinds to a halt to take a short break and examine the road 
	ahead.  You take a seat on a small boulder on the edge of the cliff to think of the past, the present, and your task.
</p>
<p>
	Growing up, you never would have expected your current predicament.  Aldoria was a small sea-hugging kingdom on the western coast,
	far away from volcanoes and such.  In fact, you recall that the must rugged terrain there were the dunes near Grant Beach.  The rest of 
	the King's domain involved plenty of hills and many lakes, and a river that drunkenly snaked through the countryside.  As is typical
	of future adventurers, you were a simple farmhand whose most dangerous opponent was a horse who had very strong objections to being
	saddled.
</p>
<p>
	That all changed several weeks ago, when the villages were suddenly awakened by a rumble, and then watched helplessly as demons rode 
	in to their towns, and rode out with most of the women and some of the men.  Entire townships were destroyed by roaming beasts the size of castles, and
	even the mighty walls of the Temple of Langhorne were breached.  The situation was dire.
</p>
<p>
	King Gregor managed to pull together enough monks and wise men to figure out where the demons were, and gathered the remnants of his army 
	together for one final, desperate adventure:  To deliver you, the only surviving virgin of the kingdom, to Mount Thermoplyae, the portal through which the 
	demons came, and seal the portal.  The only problem is that no one knows how.  Oh, and the demons will definately try to seduce or 
	kill you before you complete your mission.
</p>
<p>
	You sigh, rubbing your temples.  You've been reading through scriptures, holy texts, and even arcane tablets trying to figure out
	what you were supposed to do when you got to the summit of the volcano, all to no avail.  The portal is apparently operated on the other 
	side, so no wizard has been able to investigate too thoroughly.  You glance at the massive 
	cone-snaped volcano dominating the skyline.  The red sky is brightened by yet another eruption, which tosses 
	thousands of burning rocks, some the size of houses, thundering down onto the landscape below. You shiver, despite the growing heat, 
	just as the quartermaster motions the wagon train back into motion.
</p>
<p>
	On his word, the convoy of horses, soldiers, and wagons lurch forward and begin the arduous journey up the craggy slopes.  It soon 
	becomes apparent that the rest of the journey must be made on foot, as wagons begin to break apart on the uneven terrain or light afire
	by way of the burning debris rolling down the mountain.  The convoy is parked in a massive overhang, and everyone takes a breather.
</p>
<p>
	Aldoria, up until recently, did not have a standing army, as it had a peaceful relationship with its neighbors with regard to shipping
	products overseas, and those neighbors provided a nice, strong buffer against other nations who were not on great terms with the King.
	However, what Aldoria did have, and in great volume, was a Navy, and the Royal Aldorian Marines were the most highly trained part of it.
	Although the Navy's ships ended up at the bottom of the ocean, the Marines still made up a significant part of the current column making 
	its way through the volcanic plains.  You turn to the nearest Marine, a weary-looking soul with a shredded blue uniform hanging off 
	his bones.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Major, are you and your men ready?&quot;  You inquire, aware of the fact that you have been given the remainder of the water 
	over the past hour, and this man probably feels like hell decided to throw a party in his throat.  He snaps smartly to attention though,
	and croaks, &quot;Yes, sir!&quot;  
</p>
<p>
	You nod, and join up with the 12 marines who are tasked with getting you to the top of the mountain alive.  
	After making sure that all the weapons and provisions you need are crammed into your pack, and that the men helping you know the plan, you
	set off.  As soon as you step into towards the summit, the mountain trembles beneath your feet and blasts fresh lava down its slopes.  
	You break into a dead sprint up the roaring volcano, dodging falling rocks and jumping over yawning crevasses.  Orcs and demons step up 
	their game, and many of your men are picked off along the way up.  Soon, however, it is just you standing at the rim of the 
	volcano, staring down at the swirling vortex of molten rock below, with hordes of hungry banshees tearing towards you.
</p>
<p>
	You fling yourself into the beckoning crater, and close your eyes as the heat envelops you.
