<p>For some reason, you get it into your thick skull to wander 
out into the desert surrounding Banala (which, according to the grouchy 
Innkeeper, is called the Haara Wastes, after the demon general who led his army 
into it and was never heard from again), but this time, you bring enough water 
to get you into the blinding desert for a couple of <i>weeks</i>, provided you 
ration your water. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the desert has other plans.</p>
<p>The first day into your journey into the wastes, you 
discover, to your horror, that the goatskin bag with your water has come apart 
at the bottom, and most of the water had leaked out over the desert.  You begin 
to head back to Banala, but become aware of the fact that the sun is going 
down, and you have no idea where you are.  You sigh, check the other goatskin, 
and set up camp for the night.</p>
<p>Your sleep is fitful, and you dream of the shifting sands, 
and the creatures that might inhabit the Wastes.  You then dream of a beautiful 
woman, dressed in long, sand-colored robes, rising from the desert.  She approaches 
you, lays a hand on your cheek, and whispers your name into your ear.</p>
<p>You awaken to find a golden flask, dusted lightly in sand, 
propped up next to you.  You look around the camp quickly, but find no one.  
Wondering what the hell is going on, you peer into the flask, and find a clear 
fluid at the bottom. <i>Water? But how did...?</i>  You raise it to your lips, 
just to be sure, and taste it.  A surprising amount of water hits your lips, 
and you hungrily drink.  To your further surprise, the flask stays the same 
weight. <b>You've found my excuse to stop referencing water!</b></p>
